# DarkHorses Masters Workers - Data Collection Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive data collection strategy for the DarkHorses horse racing database. The system is designed to work within the constraints of The Racing API's different subscription tiers while maximizing data coverage for UK and Ireland horse racing.

**Key Constraints:**
- Historical racecards available from **2023-01-23 onwards** (Pro plan)
- Results API limited to **last 12 months only** (Standard plan)
- Entity search endpoints require name parameters (not suitable for bulk collection)
- API rate limit: **2 requests/second**

**Solution Approach:**
- Extract entities (jockeys, trainers, owners, horses) from race/runner data automatically
- Backfill from 2023-01-23 to present for maximum historical coverage
- Implement multi-tier update strategy (live, daily, weekly, monthly)
- Design idempotent processes safe for re-execution

## Data Sources & Availability

### What's Available & When

| Data Type | API Endpoint | Historical Availability | Current Status |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Racecards/Races** | `/v1/racecards` | 2023-01-23 onwards (Pro) | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Results** | `/v1/results` | Last 12 months only | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Courses** | `/v1/courses` | Static/Reference data | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Bookmakers** | `/v1/bookmakers` | Static/Reference data | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Jockeys** | Entity extraction | From race data | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Trainers** | Entity extraction | From race data | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Owners** | Entity extraction | From race data | IMPLEMENTED |
| **Horses** | Entity extraction | From race data | IMPLEMENTED |

### Pre-2023 Data Gap

**Problem:** Racecards API only provides data from 2023-01-23 onwards. We cannot access 2015-2022 data via the current API.

**Options for Pre-2023 Data:**

1. **Premium Data Add-On (Recommended if budget permits)**
   - Cost: Â£299 for 30+ years of results
   - Provides: Complete historical results back to 1990s
   - Implementation: Modify `initialize_data.py` to fetch from 2015 or earlier

2. **External Data Sources**
   - Racing Post historical data exports
   - British Horseracing Authority (BHA) data
   - Timeform historical database
   - Manual CSV imports from alternative providers

3. **Gradual Accumulation**
   - Accept 2023-01-23 as starting point
   - Build dataset forward from that date
   - Advantage: Free, fully automated
   - Disadvantage: No pre-2023 historical context

4. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use API for 2023+ (automated)
   - One-time manual import for 2015-2022 (if source available)
   - Merge datasets in database

**Current Implementation:** We start from 2023-01-23 (earliest available via API).

## Historical Backfill Strategy

### Initial Population (One-Time Setup)

**Script:** `initialize_data.py` (already implemented)

**Process:**
1. Fetch reference data (courses, bookmakers)
2. Fetch historical races from 2023-01-23 to present in 90-day chunks
3. Auto-extract entities from race/runner data
4. Store all data with idempotent upsert logic

**Date Range:** 2023-01-23 to current date
**Estimated Records:**
- ~750 days of racing (2023-01-23 to 2025-10-06)
- ~50-100 races per day (GB+IRE)
- ~37,500-75,000 total races
- ~10-15 runners per race
- ~375,000-1,125,000 runner records

**Execution Time:**
- 90-day chunks processed sequentially
- ~5 second pause between chunks
- Estimated total: 2-4 hours (depends on API response times)

**API Usage:**
- 2 requests per day (racecard + results)
- ~1,500 requests total for full backfill
- Rate-limited to 2 req/sec = safe execution

### 12-Month Quick Start (Alternative)

**Script:** `initialize_12months.py` (already implemented)

**Use Case:** When full historical backfill isn't needed, or for testing

**Process:**
- Last 12 months of races/results
- 30-day chunks for faster processing
- ~365 days = ~12 chunks
- Execution time: ~30-60 minutes

## Data Quality & Reconciliation

### Idempotency Strategy

All update scripts implement **upsert logic** (insert or update):
- Primary key: Entity-specific ID from API
- On conflict: Update all fields with latest data
- Safe to re-run: No duplicate records created

### Missing Data Handling

**Scenario 1: API Unavailable**
- Retry with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts)
- Log failure, continue with next entity
- Alert if consecutive failures exceed threshold

**Scenario 2: Partial Data**
- Store incomplete records with `is_complete=false` flag
- Retry fetch in next cycle
- Fill gaps during weekly reconciliation

**Scenario 3: Late Results**
- Some results marked "provisional" initially
- Weekly reconciliation catches amendments
- Compare with race status field

### Deduplication

**By Design:**
- Supabase upsert handles duplicates automatically
- Unique constraints on API IDs prevent duplicates
- Safe to fetch overlapping date ranges

---

## Options for Pre-2023 Data

### Option 1: Premium API Add-On (Best Quality)

**Cost:** Â£299 one-time for 30+ years of results

**Benefits:**
- Official Racing API data
- Consistent data structure
- Easy integration with existing code
- Historical results back to 1990s

**Implementation:**
```python
# Modify initialize_data.py
start_date = '2015-01-01'  # Or earlier
# Rest of code works as-is
```

### Option 2: Alternative Data Providers

**Sources:**
- **Racing Post:** Historical data exports (may require license)
- **Timeform:** Historical database access
- **BHA (British Horseracing Authority):** Official historical records
- **Betfair Historical Data:** Race results and market data

**Challenges:**
- Data format may differ (requires transformation)
- One-time manual import needed
- Data quality varies by source
- Licensing costs may apply

**Implementation:**
- Create separate import script: `import_historical_data.py`
- Map external data to our schema
- Handle format conversions
- Merge with API data post-2023

### Option 3: Web Scraping (Not Recommended)

**Sources:**
- Racing Post website archives
- Timeform website
- Various racing statistics sites

**Risks:**
- Terms of Service violations
- Data quality issues
- Requires constant maintenance (sites change)
- Legal issues

**Verdict:** Not recommended. Use official sources only.

### Option 4: Accept 2023+ Start Date (Most Practical)

**Rationale:**
- Zero additional cost
- Fully automated
- Clean, consistent data
- ~2.5 years of history already substantial
- Dataset grows daily

**Use Cases:**
- MVP/Initial launch: Sufficient for most features
- Machine learning: 2.5 years = good training data
- Live betting features: Recent data more relevant
- Form analysis: Recent form most predictive

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 4, upgrade to Option 1 if business requires older data.

## Storage & Retention

### Database Size Estimates

**Current (2023-01-23 to 2025-10-06):**
- Races: ~50,000 records Ã ~5 KB = 250 MB
- Runners: ~500,000 records Ã ~3 KB = 1.5 GB
- Results: ~50,000 records Ã ~2 KB = 100 MB
- Entities: ~10,000 records Ã ~2 KB = 20 MB
- **Total:** ~2 GB (compressed)

**Annual Growth:**
- ~20,000 races/year
- ~200,000 runners/year
- ~500 MB/year growth

**5-Year Projection:** ~5 GB total

### Retention Policy

**Production Data:** Retain indefinitely
- Historical value for analysis
- Storage costs low (Supabase free tier: 500 MB, Pro tier: 8 GB+)
- Regulatory: No specific retention requirements for horse racing data

**Logs:** Retain 90 days
- Application logs in `/logs` directory
- Rotate daily, compress weekly
- Archive critical error logs

**API Response Cache:** 24 hours
- Cache full API responses in `api_data` JSONB field
- Useful for debugging, reprocessing
- Can be purged if storage constrained

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Health Checks

**Metrics to Monitor:**
1. **Data Freshness:** Last successful fetch timestamp per table
2. **API Success Rate:** Percentage of successful API calls
3. **Record Counts:** Daily growth in each table
4. **Failure Rate:** Consecutive failures trigger alert

**Implementation:** `health_check.py` (already exists)

### Alert Thresholds

- **CRITICAL:** No data fetched for 24+ hours
- **WARNING:** API failure rate > 10%
- **INFO:** Unexpected record count (> 50% deviation from average)

### Logging Strategy

**Log Levels:**
- **DEBUG:** Detailed API request/response (dev only)
- **INFO:** Normal operations, record counts, success messages
- **WARNING:** Retries, missing data, minor issues
- **ERROR:** API failures, database errors, critical issues

**Log Destinations:**
- **Local:** `/logs` directory (development)
- **Production:** Render.com logs (stdout/stderr)
- **Optional:** External service (Sentry, Datadog) for production monitoring
