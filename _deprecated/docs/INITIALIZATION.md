# Database Initialization Guide

## Overview

After deploying the Masters Worker on Render.com, you need to run an **initial data collection** to populate the database with historical data from 2015 to present.

The worker's scheduled runs (daily/weekly/monthly) only collect recent data. This initialization script backfills all historical data.

---

## What Gets Initialized

### Phase 1: Reference Data
- **Courses** (~60 UK/Ireland venues)
- **Bookmakers** (~10-15 bookmakers)
- **Jockeys** (~500-1000 active jockeys)
- **Trainers** (~300-500 trainers)
- **Owners** (~500-1000 owners)
- **Horses** (~5,000-10,000 horses)

### Phase 2: Historical Data
- **Races** (from 2015-01-01 to today)
- **Results** (from 2015-01-01 to today)

---

## Running the Initialization

### Option 1: Full Initialization (Recommended)

Backfills everything from 2015-01-01 to today:

```bash
cd /Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers
python3 initialize_data.py
```

**Expected Duration:** 2-4 hours (depending on API speed)

### Option 2: Custom Start Date

Start backfill from a specific date:

```bash
python3 initialize_data.py --from 2020-01-01
```

### Option 3: Skip Reference Data

If reference data is already populated, only backfill races/results:

```bash
python3 initialize_data.py --skip-reference
```

### Option 4: Test Mode

Test the initialization with limited data (last 7 days only):

```bash
python3 initialize_data.py --test
```

---

## What Happens During Initialization

### 1. Reference Data Collection

```
PHASE 1: REFERENCE DATA COLLECTION
==================================================
STEP 1: COURSES & BOOKMAKERS
  ‚úÖ Courses: 62 records
  ‚úÖ Bookmakers: 12 records

STEP 2: JOCKEYS, TRAINERS, OWNERS & HORSES
  ‚úÖ Jockeys: 847 records
  ‚úÖ Trainers: 423 records
  ‚úÖ Owners: 612 records
  ‚úÖ Horses: 8,342 records
```

### 2. Historical Data Backfill

The script processes data in **90-day chunks** to manage API load:

```
PHASE 2: HISTORICAL RACES & RESULTS BACKFILL
==================================================
Date range: 2015-01-01 to 2025-10-06
Total days: 3,932 days
Processing in 44 chunks of ~90 days each

CHUNK 1/44: 2015-01-01 to 2015-03-31
  ‚úÖ Races: 1,247 records
  ‚úÖ Results: 9,832 records
  üìä Progress: 90/3,932 days (2.3%)
  ‚è∏Ô∏è  Pausing 5 seconds before next chunk...

CHUNK 2/44: 2015-04-01 to 2015-06-29
  ‚úÖ Races: 1,198 records
  ‚úÖ Results: 9,541 records
  üìä Progress: 180/3,932 days (4.6%)
  ...
```

### 3. Completion Summary

```
INITIALIZATION COMPLETE
==================================================
Total duration: 8,423.45 seconds (140.39 minutes)

üìã Reference Data:
   ‚úÖ Courses: 62 records
   ‚úÖ Bookmakers: 12 records
   ‚úÖ Jockeys: 847 records
   ‚úÖ Trainers: 423 records
   ‚úÖ Owners: 612 records
   ‚úÖ Horses: 8,342 records

üìä Historical Data:
   Date range: 2015-01-01 to 2025-10-06
   Total days: 3,932
   Chunks processed: 44

   Races: 54,783 records
   Results: 437,264 records

üéâ Initialization complete! Database is ready.
```

## Running on Render.com

Since this is a long-running process, you have two options:

### Option 1: Run Locally (Recommended)

Run the initialization from your local machine:

```bash
# Make sure .env.local has production credentials
cd /Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers
python3 initialize_data.py
```

**Advantages:**
- You can monitor progress in real-time
- No timeout issues
- Can pause/resume if needed

### Option 2: Run on Render.com

SSH into the Render service or create a one-time job:

```bash
# Via Render dashboard: Shell tab
python3 initialize_data.py
```

**Note:** Render may have timeout limits. For very long-running processes, local execution is safer.

---

## Monitoring Progress

The script provides detailed progress updates:

```
üìä Progress: 1,800/3,932 days (45.8%)
‚è±Ô∏è  Chunks completed: 20/44
```

Logs are also written to `logs/initialize_data.log` for review.

---

## Error Handling

### If Initialization Fails Mid-Way

The script can be resumed from where it left off:

```bash
# If it failed at 2018-06-15, resume from there
python3 initialize_data.py --from 2018-06-15 --skip-reference
```

### Common Errors

**API Rate Limiting:**
- Script includes 5-second pauses between chunks
- If you hit rate limits, increase the pause duration in the script

**Database Connection Issues:**
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check Supabase service is running

**Memory Issues:**
- Script processes in 90-day chunks to avoid memory problems
- If still issues, reduce chunk size in the script

---

## After Initialization

### 1. Verify Data

Run the deployment tests to verify everything loaded correctly:

```bash
cd tests
python3 run_deployment_tests.py
```

Expected result: All tables should have data and pass freshness checks.

### 2. Monitor Scheduled Runs

The worker will now run on schedule:
- **Daily 1:00 AM UTC:** Update races & results
- **Weekly Sunday 2:00 AM UTC:** Update people & horses
- **Monthly 1st @ 3:00 AM UTC:** Update courses & bookmakers

Check Render.com logs to verify scheduled runs are working.

---

## Estimated Database Sizes

After full initialization (2015-present):

| Table | Approximate Records |
|-------|-------------------|
| ra_courses | ~60 |
| ra_bookmakers | ~12 |
| ra_jockeys | ~1,000 |
| ra_trainers | ~500 |
| ra_owners | ~1,000 |
| ra_horses | ~10,000 |
| ra_races | ~50,000 |
| ra_results | ~400,000 |

**Total:** ~462,000 records

---

## Cost Considerations

**API Usage:**
- The Racing API may have rate limits or usage costs
- Check your Racing API plan for limits
- Initialization makes ~3,932 API calls (one per day)

**Database Storage:**
- Supabase free tier: 500MB
- Full initialization: ~100-200MB (well within free tier)
- Paid plans available if needed

**Processing Time:**
- Local execution: Free (uses your machine)
- Render execution: Counted toward service hours

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Takes Too Long

Reduce the date range:
```bash
python3 initialize_data.py --from 2020-01-01  # Last 5 years only
```

### API Errors

Check Racing API status and credentials:
```bash
curl -u USERNAME:PASSWORD https://theracingapi.com/api/v1/courses
```

### Database Full

Check Supabase dashboard for storage usage. Upgrade plan if needed.

---

## Next Steps

After successful initialization:

1. ‚úÖ Run deployment tests
2. ‚úÖ Verify data in Supabase dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Monitor scheduled worker runs
4. ‚úÖ Set up alerts for failures (optional)

Your database is now fully populated and ready for use!
