# Cleanup Summary - 2025-10-06

## Overview
Cleaned up old files from previous test runs and moved them to `_deprecated/` folder.

## Files Moved

### Deprecated Scripts (4 files)
Moved to `_deprecated/scripts/`:
- **initialize_12months.py** - Replaced by `initialize_data.py` (now supports 2015-2025)
- **monitor_initialization.py** - Replaced by `monitor_data_progress.py` (better dashboard)
- **clear_tables.py** - Replaced by `cleanup_and_reset.py` (safer deletion)
- **historical_backfill.py** - Replaced by `initialize_data.py` (unified initialization)

### Deprecated Logs (158 files)
Moved to `_deprecated/logs/`:
- **4** old initialization logs
- **68** old fetcher logs
- **76** old fetch_results JSON files
- **8** old main logs
- **2** test logs

## Current Active Files

### Active Scripts (8 files)
- `cleanup_and_reset.py` - Database cleanup utility
- `data_quality_check.py` - Data validation
- `health_check.py` - System health checks
- `initialize_data.py` - Main initialization script (2015-2025)
- `main.py` - Core orchestrator
- `monitor_data_progress.py` - Real-time monitoring dashboard
- `run_scheduled_updates.py` - Scheduled update runner
- `start_worker.py` - Worker process starter

### Active Logs
- `initialization_20251006_220657.log` - Current initialization log (955KB and growing)
- 8 current fetcher logs (from 220658 session)
- 1 current main log
- 1 current fetch_results JSON

## Current Process Status

**Initialization Process:**
- **PID**: 35402
- **Status**: âœ… Running
- **Started**: 2025-10-06 22:06:36
- **Duration**: 25+ minutes (estimated 11-16 hours total)
- **Progress**: Processing Chunk 1/44 (2015 results)

## Reason for Cleanup

All deprecated files were from previous test runs and partial attempts that occurred before:
1. The database was fully cleaned (11,131 records removed)
2. The fresh initialization started from 2015-01-01
3. The correct 2015-2025 strategy was implemented

These old files are kept for reference but are no longer needed for active operations.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Progress**: Run `python3 monitor_data_progress.py` to watch real-time progress
2. **Check Logs**: View `logs/initialization_20251006_220657.log` for detailed progress
3. **Verify Process**: Use `ps aux | grep initialize_data.py` to confirm it's running

## Storage Saved

- **Scripts**: ~50KB
- **Logs**: ~15MB
- **Total**: ~15MB moved to _deprecated/
