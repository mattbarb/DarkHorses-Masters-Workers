## Command Examples

### Recommended Production Commands

#### 1. Initial Full Population

```bash
# Process jockeys first (smallest dataset, ~7 hours)
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities jockeys

# Then trainers (~6 hours)
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities trainers

# Finally owners in background (~4 days)
nohup python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities owners > logs/owners_population.log 2>&1 &
echo $! > logs/owners_population.pid
```

#### 2. Daily/Weekly Updates

```bash
# Only process entities without statistics (new entities)
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --all --skip-existing
```

Expected time: 5-15 minutes (depending on new entity count)

#### 3. Resume Interrupted Processing

```bash
# If processing was interrupted, resume from checkpoint
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --all --resume
```

#### 4. Testing Before Production Run

```bash
# Test with 10 entities per type
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --all --limit 10

# Dry run to preview
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --all --dry-run --limit 100
```

## Monitoring Progress

### View Real-time Progress

```bash
# If running in foreground: Progress shown in console
# If running in background: Tail the log file
tail -f logs/owners_population.log
```

### Check Checkpoint Files

```bash
# View current progress
cat logs/checkpoint_jockeys.json | jq '.count'
cat logs/checkpoint_trainers.json | jq '.count'
cat logs/checkpoint_owners.json | jq '.count'

# View last update timestamp
cat logs/checkpoint_owners.json | jq '.timestamp'
```

### Check Process Status

```bash
# If saved PID to file
ps -p $(cat logs/owners_population.pid)

# Search for process
ps aux | grep populate_all_statistics
```

## File Outputs

### Checkpoint Files

**Location:** `logs/checkpoint_{entity_type}.json`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "entity_type": "jockeys",
  "processed_ids": ["jky_301080", "jky_311451", ...],
  "count": 1234,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:17:47.759849"
}
```

**Purpose:** Enable resume capability if processing is interrupted

### Report Files

**Location:** `logs/statistics_population_report_{timestamp}.json`

**Format:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:17:14.492810",
  "entity_types": ["jockeys", "trainers", "owners"],
  "mode": "production",
  "options": {
    "skip_existing": false,
    "resume": false,
    "limit": null
  },
  "statistics": {
    "jockeys": {
      "total": 3483,
      "processed": 3483,
      "successful": 3480,
      "failed": 3,
      "duration": 25434.23,
      "rate": 0.137
    }
  },
  "overall": {
    "total_entities": 54429,
    "total_processed": 54429,
    "total_successful": 54400,
    "total_failed": 29,
    "duration": 518400.0
  }
}
```

**Purpose:** Audit trail and performance tracking

## Performance Characteristics

### Processing Rate

**Observed:** 0.14 - 0.34 entities/second
**Factors:**
- API rate limit: 2 requests/second
- Result count per entity (more results = more API calls)
- Network latency
- Database update time

### Memory Usage

**Observed:** ~50-100 MB
**Characteristics:**
- Processes one entity at a time
- No large data structures in memory
- Constant memory footprint

### API Usage

**Per entity:**
- 1-20+ API calls (depending on result count)
- Automatic pagination for entities with many results
- Rate limit compliant (2 req/sec with backoff)

## Known Limitations

1. **Time Required**: Full population takes ~4.5 days continuous running
2. **API Dependency**: Requires Racing API Pro plan access
3. **Sequential Processing**: Entities processed one at a time (by design for rate limit compliance)
4. **No Parallel Processing**: Single-threaded (matches API rate limit tier)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Parallel Processing**: If API rate limit increased, could process multiple entities simultaneously
2. **Smart Prioritization**: Process recently active entities first
3. **Incremental Updates**: Track last update time, only refresh stale statistics
4. **Email Notifications**: Send notification when long-running jobs complete
5. **Database Indexes**: Add indexes on statistics fields for faster queries

## Recommended Schedule

### Production Deployment

**Week 1:**
```bash
# Day 1: Jockeys
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities jockeys

# Day 2: Trainers
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities trainers

# Day 3-7: Owners (background)
nohup python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --entities owners > logs/owners_population.log 2>&1 &
```

**Ongoing:**
```bash
# Daily cron job (5am UTC)
0 5 * * * cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py --all --skip-existing
```

## Success Criteria

- ✓ All entity types processed
- ✓ <1% failure rate
- ✓ All statistics fields populated
- ✓ Report files generated
- ✓ Checkpoint files created
- ✓ No memory leaks
- ✓ Proper error handling

## Support and Troubleshooting

See: `scripts/POPULATE_STATISTICS_GUIDE.md`

## Conclusion

The `populate_all_statistics.py` script is production-ready and has been successfully tested with:
- Dry-run mode
- Live processing
- Skip-existing functionality
- Checkpoint creation
- Report generation

**Recommendation:** Deploy to production using the staged approach (jockeys → trainers → owners) to minimize risk and allow for monitoring between stages.
