- Validation data

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: No Unique Data
The `/v1/jockeys/{jockey_id}/results` endpoint provides **NO unique fields** compared to `/v1/results`.

**Evidence:**
- Tested 34 runner-level fields
- All 34 fields present in both endpoints
- Verified with actual API calls
- Cross-referenced with /v1/results response

**Impact:** No need to change architecture or use jockey endpoint for daily operations.

---

### Finding 2: Missing Fields in Current Implementation
We're **NOT capturing 7 important fields** that ARE available in `/v1/results`:

| Field | Priority | Why Missing |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `time` | **HIGH** | We focused on position, not timing |
| `sp_dec` | **HIGH** | We captured fractional but not decimal |
| `ovr_btn` | MEDIUM | Overlooked during initial implementation |
| `weight` (stones-lbs) | LOW | We have weight_lbs, missed formatted version |
| `jockey_claim_lbs` | MEDIUM | Partially captured |
| `comment` | **HIGH** | Schema exists but not populated |
| `silk_url` | HIGH | Schema exists but not populated |

**Impact:** Simple code update adds significant ML value.

---

### Finding 3: Finishing Time is Critical
Individual finishing times are **essential for ML** but we're not capturing them.

**Why Critical:**
- True performance measurement (not just relative position)
- Pace analysis (early/late speed patterns)
- Track condition assessment
- Form comparison across races
- Speed ratings and time-based handicapping

**Example:**
```
Horse A: 3rd place, 1:27.07 (2.07s slower than standard)
Horse B: 1st place, 1:30.50 (5.50s slower than standard)

Horse A performed better despite lower position!
```

---

### Finding 4: Entity Results Pattern
Similar endpoints exist for all entity types:

| Endpoint | Status | Response Structure |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| `/v1/jockeys/{id}/results` | ✓ Works | Complete race + runners |
| `/v1/trainers/{id}/results` | ✓ Works | Complete race + runners |
| `/v1/horses/{id}/results` | ✓ Works | Complete race + runners |
| `/v1/owners/{id}/results` | ✓ Works | Complete race + runners |
| `/v1/{entity}/{id}/results/pro` | ✗ 404 | Does not exist |

**Use Cases:** Individual entity profiles, historical research (>12 months)
**Not For:** Daily operations (too slow, no unique data)

---

## Recommendations

### ✓ RECOMMENDED: Update results_fetcher.py

**Action:** Capture 7 missing fields from `/v1/results`

**Effort:** ~1 hour
- 15 min: Database migration
- 30 min: Update fetchers
- 10 min: Testing
- 5 min: Validation

**Risk:** Low (additive changes only)

**Value:** High (especially for ML)

**Implementation:** See `docs/analysis/MISSING_FIELDS_ACTION_PLAN.md`

---

### ✓ RECOMMENDED: Continue current architecture

**Action:** Keep using `/v1/results` as primary source

**Reason:**
- Most efficient for bulk operations
- Contains all necessary fields
- Simple, proven approach
- No rate limit concerns

---

### ✗ NOT RECOMMENDED: Use jockey endpoint for daily operations

**Reason:**
- No unique data benefit
- Too slow (4.7 hours for all jockeys)
- Unnecessary complexity
- Same data available in /v1/results

---

### ? OPTIONAL: Consider entity endpoints for special cases

**When to use:**
- Individual entity profile pages
- Historical research (>12 months)
- One-off analysis projects
- Entity-specific reports

**When NOT to use:**
- Daily data pipeline
- Bulk operations
- Replacing current architecture
