# Entity Statistics Deployment Summary

## Current Status

✅ **Migration 007 Complete** - Statistics columns exist in database
✅ **Statistics calculation function exists** - `update_entity_statistics()` in Supabase
✅ **Python scripts created** - Multiple approaches available
✅ **Worker Integration Complete** - Statistics update automatically after daily/weekly fetches
✅ **Supabase Cron Available** - Backup automation via pg_cron (optional)

## The Problem (SOLVED)

The statistics calculation takes 30-90 seconds with a large dataset. Supabase's PostgREST API has a statement timeout (typically 8-10 seconds) that cannot be increased from the client side.

**Solution:** Statistics are now automatically updated by the worker after each data fetch. The timeout may still occur on very large datasets, but the cron job provides a backup mechanism.

## Solutions (All Implemented)

### Solution 1: Worker Integration (PRIMARY) ⭐⭐⭐

**Best for:** Automatic updates after data changes

**Status:** ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** in `start_worker.py`

Statistics are automatically updated after:
- Daily fetch completes (1:00 AM UTC) - after races and results
- Weekly fetch completes (Sunday 2:00 AM UTC) - after entity updates

**Implementation:**
```python
# In start_worker.py - run_daily_fetch() and run_weekly_fetch()
if success:
    logger.info("Daily fetch completed successfully")
    logger.info("\nUpdating entity statistics with new data...")
    update_entity_statistics()
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fully automatic - runs after every data update
- ✅ No manual intervention required
- ✅ Integrated into existing workflow
- ✅ Statistics always reflect latest data

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May timeout with very large datasets (8-10 second API limit)
- ⚠️ If timeout occurs, falls back to cron job

### Solution 2: Supabase Scheduled Task (BACKUP) ⭐⭐

**Best for:** Backup automation if worker timeout occurs

**Status:** ✅ **AVAILABLE** - Setup file created: `SETUP_SUPABASE_CRON.sql`

Use Supabase's built-in pg_cron feature:

1. Run `SETUP_SUPABASE_CRON.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Scheduled to run daily at 3:00 AM UTC (after worker runs)
3. Provides backup if worker statistics update times out

**Pros:**
- ✅ Runs server-side (no timeout issues)
- ✅ Fully automatic backup mechanism
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Built into Supabase Pro

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires Supabase Pro plan (pg_cron extension)
- ⚠️ Redundant if worker updates succeed
- ⚠️ Fixed schedule (not triggered by data changes)

**Recommended:** Set up as backup safety net in case worker timeouts occur.

### Solution 3: External Cron Job on Server

**Best for:** Running on your own server (Render, AWS, etc.)

Add to your server's crontab:

```bash
# Run daily at 2 AM after results fetch
0 2 * * * psql "$SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING" -c "SELECT * FROM update_entity_statistics();"
```

Or use Render's cron job feature with a simple script.

**Pros:**
- ✅ Runs server-side (no timeout)
- ✅ Can schedule after other tasks
- ✅ Free (uses your existing server)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires server access
- ⚠️ Need to manage connection credentials

### Solution 4: Manual Update (Emergency Fallback)

**Best for:** Emergency updates or troubleshooting

Run manually in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SET statement_timeout = '300s';
SELECT * FROM update_entity_statistics();
RESET statement_timeout;
```

**Frequency:** Run weekly or after major data updates

**Pros:**
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Full control

**Cons:**
- ❌ Manual process
- ❌ Easy to forget

## Current Production Setup

**Primary Mechanism:** Worker Integration (Solution 1)
- ✅ Statistics update automatically after daily fetch (1:00 AM UTC)
- ✅ Statistics update automatically after weekly fetch (Sunday 2:00 AM UTC)
- ✅ Logs statistics update results
- ✅ Graceful error handling (continues if timeout occurs)

**Backup Mechanism:** Supabase Cron Job (Solution 2) - OPTIONAL
- Run `SETUP_SUPABASE_CRON.sql` to enable
- Scheduled for 3:00 AM UTC (after worker runs)
- Provides safety net if worker times out

**Recommendation:**
1. **Deploy worker** with integrated statistics updates (already implemented)
2. **Optionally set up cron job** as backup (run `SETUP_SUPABASE_CRON.sql`)
3. **Monitor logs** for timeout errors
4. If timeouts occur frequently, rely on cron job as primary mechanism

## How to Run Manually (Interim Solution)

### Option A: Via Supabase SQL Editor (Easiest)

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run:
   ```sql
   SET statement_timeout = '300s';
   SELECT * FROM update_entity_statistics();
   RESET statement_timeout;
   ```

### Option B: Copy/Paste SQL File

1. Open `RUN_STATISTICS_UPDATE.sql`
2. Copy all contents
3. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"

## Expected Results

After running, you should see:

```
jockeys_updated  | trainers_updated | owners_updated
1000            | 1200             | 2500
```

(Actual numbers depend on your data)

## Verification Queries

After statistics update, verify data:

```sql
-- Check jockey statistics
SELECT name, total_rides, total_wins, win_rate, stats_updated_at
FROM ra_jockeys
WHERE total_rides > 0
ORDER BY win_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check trainer statistics
SELECT name, total_runners, total_wins, win_rate, recent_14d_win_rate, stats_updated_at
FROM ra_trainers
WHERE total_runners > 0
ORDER BY win_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check owner statistics
SELECT name, total_horses, total_runners, total_wins, win_rate, stats_updated_at
FROM ra_owners
WHERE total_runners > 0
ORDER BY win_rate DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## What Statistics Are Calculated

### Jockeys
- `total_rides` - Total number of rides
- `total_wins` - Total wins (1st place)
- `total_places` - Total places (top 3)
- `win_rate` - Win percentage (0-100)
- `place_rate` - Place percentage (0-100)

### Trainers
- `total_runners` - Total runners
- `total_wins` - Total wins
- `total_places` - Total places
- `win_rate` - Win percentage
- `place_rate` - Place percentage
- `recent_14d_runs` - Runners in last 14 days
- `recent_14d_wins` - Wins in last 14 days
- `recent_14d_win_rate` - Recent win percentage

### Owners
- `total_horses` - Number of unique horses
- `total_runners` - Total runners
- `total_wins` - Total wins
- `total_places` - Total places
- `win_rate` - Win percentage
- `place_rate` - Place percentage
- `active_last_30d` - Active in last 30 days (boolean)

## Integration with Worker (COMPLETE)

The daily workflow is now:

1. Worker triggers `run_daily_fetch()` at 1:00 AM UTC
2. Fetches races and results via `main.py`
3. Updates `ra_runners` with new data
4. **Automatically triggers statistics calculation** via `update_entity_statistics()`
5. Statistics are immediately up-to-date for ML models

The weekly workflow:

1. Worker triggers `run_weekly_fetch()` at Sunday 2:00 AM UTC
2. Fetches jockeys, trainers, owners, horses via `main.py`
3. Updates entity tables with new data
4. **Automatically triggers statistics calculation**
5. Statistics reflect all entity updates
