# Calculated Tables Implementation

**Created:** 2025-10-22
**Purpose:** Document implementation of database calculation scripts for derived tables

## Overview

Following the discovery that 5 of 11 "planned" tables were already operational (see `/docs/PLANNED_TABLES_ACTUAL_STATUS.md`), we've implemented scripts to populate the remaining calculation-based tables using existing data.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented

#### 1. ra_entity_combinations
- **Purpose:** Track jockey-trainer partnership statistics
- **Data Source:** Aggregated from ra_mst_runners table
- **Script:** `/scripts/populate_entity_combinations_from_runners.py`
- **Calculation:** Groups runners by jockey_id + trainer_id, calculates win rates
- **Status:** ✅ Working - Successfully populated with jockey-trainer partnerships
- **Constraints:**
  - `chk_entity_comb_types` - Only allows jockey+trainer pairs (not horse combinations)
  - `chk_entity_comb_canonical_order` - Requires entity types in alphabetical order
- **Default Threshold:** 5+ runs minimum
- **Update Schedule:** Daily or weekly

**Sample Output:**
```
Top jockey-trainer partnerships:
- jky_279558 + trn_301977: 18 runs, 18 wins (100%)
- jky_255654 + trn_146430: 16 runs, 16 wins (100%)
- jky_259506 + trn_13275: 13 runs, 13 wins (100%)
```

#### 2. ra_runner_odds
- **Purpose:** Aggregated odds data for faster runner queries
- **Data Sources:**
  - ra_odds_live (213K rows) - Pre-race odds snapshots
  - ra_odds_historical (2.4M rows) - Post-race SP data
- **Script:** `/scripts/populate_runner_odds.py`
- **Calculation:** Latest odds per race/horse/bookmaker combination
- **Status:** ✅ Script created
- **Known Limitation:** Historical odds lack race_id/horse_id (uses horse_name/track matching)
- **Default:** Process last 7 days
- **Update Schedule:** Daily

**Note on Historical Data:**
The ra_odds_historical table contains SP (Starting Price) data from Excel imports (2017+) but uses different identifiers (horse_name, track, date_of_race) rather than race_id/horse_id. Matching historical odds to ra_mst_runners would require:
- Fuzzy name matching
- Date + track + race_time alignment
- Or: Backfill race_id/horse_id into ra_odds_historical

**Current Implementation:** Only aggregates ra_odds_live (which has proper IDs)

### ✅ Implemented (Phase 2 - Analytics)

#### 3. ra_runner_statistics
- **Purpose:** Individual runner-level performance metrics grouped by conditions
- **Data Source:** Aggregated from ra_mst_runners + ra_mst_races tables
- **Script:** `/scripts/populate_runner_statistics.py`
- **Calculation:** For each race entry (runner), calculate horse's career stats, course performance, distance performance, going performance, recent form, jockey partnership stats
- **Status:** ✅ Working - Successfully calculates 60 statistical fields per runner
- **Fields Calculated:**
  - Career: prize money, win/place percentages
  - Course: runs/wins/places at this course
  - Distance: runs/wins/places at this distance
  - Going: firm/good/soft/heavy ground performance
  - Surface: all-weather vs jumps performance
  - Jockey: runs/wins with this jockey
  - Recent: last 10 runs, last 12 months
- **Default Threshold:** 3+ career runs minimum
- **Update Schedule:** Daily or weekly

**Sample Output:**
```
Top performers by career win %:
- Horse hrs_30207716: 100.0% wins, 1 course wins, 2 distance wins
- Horse hrs_41877619: 100.0% wins, 2 course wins, 2 distance wins
```

#### 4. ra_performance_by_distance
- **Purpose:** Performance analysis grouped by distance ranges for multiple entity types
- **Data Source:** Aggregated from ra_mst_runners + ra_mst_races tables
- **Script:** `/scripts/populate_performance_by_distance.py`
- **Calculation:** Groups performance by entity (horse/jockey/trainer) and distance, calculates win rates, A/E index, P/L, finishing times
- **Status:** ✅ Working - Successfully tracks performance at different distances
- **Entity Types:** horse, jockey, trainer
- **Distance Categories:**
  - Sprint: 5f-7f (1000-1400 yards)
  - Mile: 7f-9f (1400-1800 yards)
  - Middle: 9f-12f (1800-2400 yards)
  - Staying: 12f+ (2400+ yards)
- **Metrics:** Total runs, wins, places, win%, place%, A/E index, P/L, best/avg/last times, going breakdown
- **Default Threshold:** 5+ runs at distance minimum
- **Update Schedule:** Daily or weekly

**Sample Output:**
```
Breakdown by entity type:
  horse: 30 records
  jockey: 195 records
  trainer: 183 records
```

#### 5. ra_performance_by_venue
- **Purpose:** Course specialist identification - which entities excel at specific venues
- **Data Source:** Aggregated from ra_mst_runners + ra_mst_races tables
- **Script:** `/scripts/populate_performance_by_venue.py`
- **Calculation:** Groups performance by entity and venue (course), calculates win rates, A/E index, P/L
- **Status:** ✅ Working - Successfully identifies course specialists
- **Entity Types:** jockey, trainer (most relevant for venue analysis)
- **Metrics:** Total runs, wins, places, win%, place%, A/E index, P/L at each venue
- **Use Cases:**
  - Identify jockeys who excel at specific courses
  - Track trainers with strong venue records
  - ML feature: "Has this jockey won at this course before?"
- **Default Threshold:** 5+ runs at venue minimum
- **Update Schedule:** Daily or weekly
- **Constraint Note:** Table schema restricts entity_type to jockey and trainer only (not horse or sire)

**Sample Output:**
```
Breakdown by entity type:
  jockey: 154 records (e.g., jockey jky_259506 at course crs_4602: 100% wins)
  trainer: 132 records
```

#### 6. ra_runner_supplementary
- **Status:** Table exists but purpose unclear
- **Recommendation:** Define requirements or deprecate

## Scheduling Recommendations

### Daily Schedule (After Results Update)

```bash
# Phase 1: Run at 2:00 AM (after results_fetcher completes at ~1:00 AM)
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/populate_calculated_tables.py >> logs/calculated_tables.log 2>&1

# Phase 2: Run at 2:15 AM (after Phase 1 completes)
15 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/populate_phase2_analytics.py >> logs/phase2_analytics.log 2>&1
```

This keeps derived tables fresh with yesterday's results.

### Weekly Full Recalculation

```bash
# Sunday at 3:00 AM - Phase 1 with higher thresholds
0 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/populate_calculated_tables.py --min-runs 10 --days-back 30 >> logs/calculated_tables_weekly.log 2>&1

# Sunday at 3:15 AM - Phase 2 with higher thresholds
15 3 * * 0 cd /path/to/project && python3 scripts/populate_phase2_analytics.py --min-runs-runner 5 --min-runs-distance 10 --min-runs-venue 10 >> logs/phase2_analytics_weekly.log 2>&1
```

This rebuilds with more stringent criteria and broader time range.

## Database Updates Required

### For ra_runner_odds to use Historical Data

To enable aggregation from ra_odds_historical, add matching fields:

```sql
-- Add normalized identifiers to ra_odds_historical
ALTER TABLE ra_odds_historical
ADD COLUMN race_id VARCHAR,
ADD COLUMN horse_id VARCHAR;

-- Create matching script to populate from horse_name/track/date
-- scripts/match_historical_odds_to_races.py
```

This would unlock 2.4M historical SP records for aggregation.

---

## Key Discoveries

### ra_entity_combinations is Partnership-Specific

The table schema suggests it could handle any entity pair (horse-jockey, trainer-owner, etc.), but the `chk_entity_comb_types` constraint restricts it to **jockey-trainer partnerships only**.

**Why this design?**
- Focuses on professional partnerships (jockey-trainer are the most stable)
- Horse-jockey/horse-trainer pairs are more transient
- Could create separate tables for other combination types if needed

### Odds Data is Already Comprehensive

With 213K live odds and 2.4M historical odds already in the database, the odds infrastructure is production-ready. The ra_runner_odds table provides a summary/cache layer for faster queries.
