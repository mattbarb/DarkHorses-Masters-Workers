# Database Schema Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Audit Type:** Comprehensive database vs API schema comparison
**Tables Audited:** 7 (all ra_* tables)
**Records Analyzed:** 679,373 database records

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Position Data Not Being Captured (CRITICAL)

**Impact:** Blocks 43% of ML model functionality

**Details:**
- Position, distance_beaten, prize_won, starting_price, finishing_time all 100% NULL
- These fields ARE in the database schema (migration 005)
- These fields ARE in the Results API (100% availability)
- Results fetcher has extraction code but it's **not being called**

**Solution:**
```python
# In results_fetcher.py fetch_and_store() method
# This code exists but is not being executed:

runner_records = self._prepare_runner_records(all_results)
if runner_records:
    runner_stats = self.db_client.insert_runners(runner_records)
```

**Effort:** 1 hour to enable + 3 hours backfill
**Priority:** P0 - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY

### 2. Entity Tables "Lite on Data" (HIGH)

**ra_horses:** 4 out of 9 fields are 100% NULL
- Missing: dob, sex_code, colour, region (all available in API)

**ra_trainers:** location field is 100% NULL
- Missing: trainer_location (90% available in API)

**ra_jockeys:** No statistics fields
- Missing: total_rides, total_wins, win_rate (calculate from data)

**ra_owners:** No statistics fields
- Missing: total_horses, total_runners, win_rate (calculate from data)

**Effort:** 10 hours total
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH

### 3. Low Runner Count (HIGH)

**Issue:** Only 2.78 runners per race (expected: 8-12)
- Total races: 136,648
- Total runners: 379,422
- Expected runners: ~1,366,000
- **Missing ~987,000 runner records**

**Possible Causes:**
- Filtering logic removing valid runners
- Extraction logic skipping non-finishers
- API not returning all runners

**Effort:** 2-4 hours investigation
**Priority:** P1 - HIGH

### 4. ra_horse_pedigree Table Empty (FALSE ALARM)

**Issue:** 0 records in ra_horse_pedigree table

**Reality:** Pedigree data IS being captured!
- sire_id, dam_id, damsire_id stored in ra_mst_runners (100% populated)
- ra_horse_pedigree table not needed
- Architecture uses denormalized approach

**Resolution:** No action needed (data already captured)
**Priority:** P0 - RESOLVED

## Quick Wins (Week 1 - 14 hours)

### P0: Enable Position Data (4 hours)
1. Uncomment/enable runner extraction in results_fetcher.py (1 hour)
2. Test on sample date (1 hour)
3. Backfill last 12 months (3 hours runtime)

**Impact:** Unlocks 43% of ML model

### P1: Fix Core Data Issues (10 hours)
1. Fix distance_meters and prize_money parsing (2 hours)
2. Extract going_detailed and weather (1 hour)
3. Populate dob and trainer location (3 hours)
4. Extract trainer_14_days and days_since_last_run (3 hours)
5. Fix headgear population (1 hour)

**Impact:** Completes core data capture, 85% of ML fields functional

---

## Medium Priority (Weeks 2-3 - 19.5 hours)

### Add Entity Statistics
- Jockey statistics (4 hours)
- Trainer statistics (4 hours)
- Owner statistics (3 hours)
- Pedigree region extraction (2 hours)
- Other enhancements (6.5 hours)

**Impact:** Enhanced analytics, 95% of ML fields functional

## Data Quality Summary

| Table | Records | NULL Columns | Status |
|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| ra_mst_races | 136,648 | 16 entirely NULL (36%) | Needs fixes |
| ra_mst_runners | 379,422 | 23 entirely NULL (33%) | CRITICAL - position data |
| ra_horses | 111,430 | 4 entirely NULL (44%) | Missing fields |
| ra_jockeys | 3,480 | 0 entirely NULL | Missing stats |
| ra_trainers | 2,780 | 1 entirely NULL | Missing location + stats |
| ra_owners | 48,092 | 0 entirely NULL | Missing stats |
| ra_courses | 101 | 0 entirely NULL | ✓ Perfect |

**Overall:** 44 entirely NULL columns across all tables

## Recommended Action Plan

**THIS WEEK (Must Do):**

Day 1-2: Position Data
- [ ] Enable position extraction in results_fetcher.py (1h)
- [ ] Test on October 1st data (1h)
- [ ] Backfill last 12 months (3h runtime)
- [ ] Verify ML compilation works (1h)

Day 3-4: Core Fields
- [ ] Fix distance_meters and prize_money (2h)
- [ ] Extract weather and track conditions (1h)
- [ ] Populate horse dob and trainer location (3h)
- [ ] Extract trainer form and last run days (3h)

Day 5: Testing
- [ ] Fix headgear population (1h)
- [ ] Run full test suite (2h)
- [ ] Document changes (1h)

**Total Week 1:** 19 hours → 85% of ML model functional

**NEXT 2 WEEKS (Should Do):**

- [ ] Create statistics calculation job (4h)
- [ ] Extract additional runner fields (6h)
- [ ] Investigate low runner count issue (4h)
- [ ] Test and validate (2h)

**Total Weeks 2-3:** 16 hours → 95% of ML model functional

## Files to Update

**Critical (P0/P1):**
- `fetchers/results_fetcher.py` - Enable position extraction
- `fetchers/races_fetcher.py` - Extract additional fields
- `utils/entity_extractor.py` - Populate entity fields

**Important (P2):**
- `scripts/calculate_entity_statistics.py` - New file to create
- `scripts/backfill_position_data.py` - New file to create

---

## Key Insights

1. **Position data is the #1 blocker** - affects 43% of ML model
2. **Most missing data is actually available** - just not being extracted
3. **ra_horse_pedigree not needed** - data already in ra_mst_runners (good architecture)
4. **Entity tables need statistics** - but data exists to calculate them
5. **Low runner count is suspicious** - needs investigation
6. **API provides everything we need** - no new endpoints required

---

## Questions for User

1. **Position data extraction:** Can we enable this immediately? (1 hour fix, critical impact)
2. **Backfill timeline:** When should we run the 3-hour backfill job?
3. **Low runner count:** Should we investigate why only 2.78 runners/race?
4. **Statistics frequency:** How often should we recalculate entity statistics? (Daily? Weekly?)
5. **Priority approval:** Agree with P0 → P1 → P2 priority order?
