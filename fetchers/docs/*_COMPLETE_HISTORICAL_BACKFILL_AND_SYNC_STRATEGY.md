---

## 📊 Two-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Historical Backfill (ONE-TIME)
**Purpose:** Populate all historical data from 2015-01-01
**Duration:** 5-6 hours (one-time execution)
**Script:** `scripts/backfill/backfill_events.py`
**Status:** ✅ **UPDATED WITH HORSE_ID CAPTURE** (2025-10-23)

**Recent Enhancement:** Now captures `horse_id` links for sires/dams/damsires via database lookup during extraction

### Phase 2: Ongoing Sync (CONTINUOUS)
**Purpose:** Keep data current with daily racing
**Duration:** Continuous (scheduled via cron)
**Scripts:** Multiple fetchers + calculated tables
**Status:** ⏳ Ready to activate (after backfill completes)

---

## 🔧 Phase 1: Historical Backfill Details

### What It Does

The backfill script processes **10+ years of historical racing data** in monthly chunks:

1. **Fetches racecards** (pre-race data) for every day from 2015-01-01
2. **Fetches results** (post-race data) for every day
3. **Extracts entities** automatically (horses, jockeys, trainers, owners, pedigree)
4. **Enriches horses** with complete pedigree via Pro API endpoint
5. **Uses UPSERT** operations to avoid duplicates
6. **Saves checkpoints** every chunk for resume capability

### Tables Populated (14 of 18)

**Transaction Tables (4):**
1. ✅ `ra_races` - Race metadata
2. ✅ `ra_runners` - Runner entries with complete details
3. ✅ `ra_race_results` - Historical results with positions/times
4. ✅ `ra_horse_pedigree` - Complete pedigree (sire, dam, damsire)

**Master Tables (7):**
5. ✅ `ra_mst_horses` - All horses discovered (enriched)
6. ✅ `ra_mst_jockeys` - All jockeys extracted
7. ✅ `ra_mst_trainers` - All trainers extracted
8. ✅ `ra_mst_owners` - All owners extracted
9. ✅ `ra_mst_sires` - All sires (fathers) extracted
10. ✅ `ra_mst_dams` - All dams (mothers) extracted
11. ✅ `ra_mst_damsires` - All damsires (maternal grandfathers) extracted

**Static Reference Tables (3):**
12. ✅ `ra_mst_courses` - All UK/Ireland courses
13. ✅ `ra_mst_bookmakers` - All bookmakers
14. ✅ `ra_mst_regions` - Region codes (GB, IRE)

### Command to Run

```bash
# Start backfill from 2015-01-01
PYTHONPATH=/Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers \
python3 scripts/backfill/backfill_events.py \
--start-date 2015-01-01 \
--resume \
2>&1 | tee logs/backfill_ERROR_FREE.log
```

**Key flags:**
- `--start-date 2015-01-01` - Start from January 1, 2015
- `--resume` - Resume from last checkpoint if interrupted
- `2>&1 | tee` - Log all output to file

### Current Execution Status

**✅ RUNNING ERROR-FREE** as of 2025-10-23 20:23:

```
Chunk 11/130: 2015-11-01 to 2015-11-30
✅ Updated 548 runners with results
✅ Chunk 11 completed successfully
```

**Progress:**
- Current: Chunk 11/130 (8.5% complete)
- Processing: November 2015
- Estimated time remaining: ~5 hours

### Expected Final Data Volume

| Entity | Estimated Count |
|--------|----------------|
| Races | ~150,000 races |
| Runners | ~1,500,000 runner entries |
| Horses | ~200,000 unique horses |
| Jockeys | ~5,000 unique jockeys |
| Trainers | ~3,000 unique trainers |
| Owners | ~25,000 unique owners |
| Pedigree records | ~200,000 (complete lineage) |

## 🛡️ Error Resolution History

### Problem: NULL Constraint Violations

Historical results API doesn't always provide all pre-race fields. We resolved this with targeted migrations:

#### Migration 027: horse_name → NULLABLE
**Issue:** `null value in column "horse_name" violates not-null constraint`
**Solution:** Make `horse_name` nullable (we have `horse_id` FK to join)
**Status:** ✅ Applied successfully

#### Migration 028: number → NULLABLE
**Issue:** `null value in column "number" violates not-null constraint`
**Solution:** Make saddle cloth `number` nullable (not always in historical data)
**Status:** ✅ Applied successfully

#### Migration 029: All Pre-Race Fields → NULLABLE
**Issue:** `null value in column "draw" violates not-null constraint`
**Solution:** Make all pre-race fields nullable:
- `draw` (starting position)
- `weight_lbs` (carried weight)
- `jockey_name` (jockey name - can join via jockey_id)
- `trainer_name` (trainer name - can join via trainer_id)
- `owner_name` (owner name - can join via owner_id)

**Rationale:** Pre-race data comes from racecards, not results. Historical results only provide post-race data (positions, times, prizes). Making these nullable allows results updates without requiring all fields.

**Status:** ✅ Applied successfully

**Result:** ✅ **BACKFILL NOW RUNNING COMPLETELY ERROR-FREE**

### Migration Files

All migrations are documented in:
```
migrations/027_make_horse_name_nullable_in_runners.sql
migrations/028_make_number_nullable_in_runners.sql
migrations/029_make_all_result_fields_nullable.sql
```

## 🔗 Sire/Dam/Damsire horse_id Linkage (NEW - 2025-10-23)

### Problem Identified

The `ra_mst_sires`, `ra_mst_dams`, and `ra_mst_damsires` tables have `horse_id` columns that link to full horse records in `ra_mst_horses`, but the Racing API does NOT provide these links directly.

### Solution Implemented

**Database Lookup During Extraction:**

The `EntityExtractor` now performs real-time database lookups to match sire/dam/damsire names to existing horses:

```python
# In utils/entity_extractor.py
def _lookup_horse_id_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Look up horse_id in database by horse name"""
    result = self.db_client.client.table('ra_mst_horses')\
        .select('horse_id')\
        .ilike('horse_name', name)\
        .limit(1)\
        .execute()
    return result.data[0].get('horse_id') if result.data else None
```

### What This Enables

✅ **Sires/dams/damsires** are linked to their full horse records when they exist
✅ **Automatic matching** during backfill and ongoing sync
✅ **ML features unlocked:** Sire's age at breeding, race performance, pedigree analysis
✅ **Graceful degradation:** NULL horse_id is acceptable for foreign stallions/broodmares

### Expected Coverage

- **Sires that raced in UK/IRE:** ~85% will have horse_id
- **Dams that raced:** ~70% will have horse_id
- **Foreign/unraced breeding stock:** Will have NULL horse_id (acceptable)

### Files Modified

- `utils/entity_extractor.py` - Added `_lookup_horse_id_by_name()` method
- `utils/entity_extractor.py` - Updated `extract_breeding_from_runners()` to capture horse_ids

---

## 🔄 UPSERT Strategy (Deduplication)

### How It Works

All database inserts use PostgreSQL **UPSERT** operations:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (...)
VALUES (...)
ON CONFLICT (primary_key)
DO UPDATE SET
  column1 = EXCLUDED.column1,
  column2 = EXCLUDED.column2,
  ...
```

### What This Means

✅ **Safe to re-run** - No duplicates will be created
✅ **Always current** - Existing records are updated with latest data
✅ **Idempotent** - Running multiple times produces same result as once

### Primary Keys Used

| Table | Primary Key |
|-------|-------------|
| `ra_races` | `race_id` |
| `ra_runners` | `(race_id, horse_id)` composite |
| `ra_race_results` | `(race_id, horse_id)` composite |
| `ra_horse_pedigree` | `horse_id` |
| `ra_mst_horses` | `horse_id` |
| `ra_mst_jockeys` | `jockey_id` |
| `ra_mst_trainers` | `trainer_id` |
| `ra_mst_owners` | `owner_id` |
| `ra_mst_sires` | `sire_id` |
| `ra_mst_dams` | `dam_id` |
| `ra_mst_damsires` | `damsire_id` |

### Checkpoint System

The backfill also maintains a **checkpoint file** (`logs/backfill_checkpoint.json`):

```json
{
  "last_completed_chunk": 11,
  "total_chunks": 130,
  "last_chunk_end_date": "2015-11-30",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-23T20:23:00Z"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Resume from interruption point with `--resume` flag
- Skip already-processed chunks
- Track progress through 130 monthly chunks

---

## 📅 Phase 2: Ongoing Sync Schedule

After backfill completes, activate scheduled syncs to keep data current.

### Schedule Overview (UK Time)

| Time | Frequency | What Runs | Tables |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **06:00** | Every 4 hours | Transaction sync | Races, runners, results |
| **10:00** | Every 4 hours | Transaction sync | Races, runners, results |
| **13:00** | Daily | Master tables | All master/reference tables |
| **14:00** | Every 4 hours | Transaction sync | Races, runners, results |
| **18:00** | Every 4 hours | Transaction sync | Races, runners, results |
| **22:00** | Every 4 hours | Transaction sync | Races, runners, results |
| **02:30** | Daily | Statistics calculation | 4 calculated tables |

### Cron Configuration

#### Option 1: Simple (3 Jobs)

```bash
# 1. Transaction tables (every 4 hours)
0 6,10,14,18,22 * * * cd /Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers && PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 fetchers/events_fetcher.py --days-back 1 >> logs/cron_transactions.log 2>&1

# 2. Master tables (daily at 1pm)
0 13 * * * cd /Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers && PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 fetchers/masters_fetcher.py >> logs/cron_masters.log 2>&1

# 3. Calculated tables (daily at 2:30am)
30 2 * * * cd /Users/matthewbarber/Documents/GitHub/DarkHorses-Masters-Workers && PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py >> logs/cron_statistics.log 2>&1
```

#### Option 2: Comprehensive (Detailed Scheduling)

See `fetchers/schedules/COMPLETE_18_TABLES_SCHEDULE.md` for full cron setup with:
- Monthly syncs for static data (courses, bookmakers)
- Weekly syncs for people data (jockeys, trainers, owners)
- Daily syncs for horse data (with enrichment)
- Every 4-hour syncs for race data
- Daily statistics calculations

### Statistics Calculation (4 Tables)

The following 4 tables are **calculated from source data**, not fetched:

15. ✅ `ra_entity_combinations` - Jockey-trainer partnership stats
16. ✅ `ra_performance_by_distance` - Distance specialist identification
17. ✅ `ra_performance_by_venue` - Venue specialist identification
18. ✅ `ra_runner_statistics` - 60 performance metrics per runner

**Command to calculate:**

```bash
# Calculate all statistics from ra_race_results
python3 scripts/populate_all_statistics.py
```

**Runtime:** 15-25 minutes
**Data source:** `ra_race_results` table (no API calls)

---

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### Check Backfill Progress

```bash
# View current chunk progress
tail -f logs/backfill_ERROR_FREE.log

# Check checkpoint status
cat logs/backfill_checkpoint.json

# Estimate completion
# Formula: (130 - current_chunk) * 2.5 minutes ≈ remaining time
```

### Verify Data Population

```sql
-- Check race coverage by year
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date) as year,
  COUNT(*) as races,
  COUNT(DISTINCT course_id) as unique_courses
FROM ra_races
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)
ORDER BY year;

-- Check runner volume
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_runners,
  COUNT(DISTINCT horse_id) as unique_horses,
  COUNT(DISTINCT jockey_id) as unique_jockeys
FROM ra_runners;

-- Check pedigree coverage
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_horses,
  COUNT(p.horse_id) as with_pedigree,
  ROUND(COUNT(p.horse_id)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as coverage_pct
FROM ra_mst_horses h
LEFT JOIN ra_horse_pedigree p ON h.horse_id = p.horse_id;

-- Check results completion
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_runners,
  COUNT(position) as with_positions,
  ROUND(COUNT(position)::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as results_pct
FROM ra_runners;
```

### Check for Errors

```bash
# Find errors in backfill log
grep -i "error\|failed\|exception" logs/backfill_ERROR_FREE.log

# Check NULL constraint violations (should be ZERO)
grep -i "null value in column" logs/backfill_ERROR_FREE.log

# Verify rate limiting handling
grep -i "rate limited" logs/backfill_ERROR_FREE.log
```

### Monitor Cron Jobs (After Phase 2 Activation)

```bash
# View installed cron jobs
crontab -l

# Check if cron ran
tail -f logs/cron_transactions.log
tail -f logs/cron_masters.log
tail -f logs/cron_statistics.log

# Find cron errors
grep -i "error\|failed" logs/cron_*.log
```

## 📐 Rate Limiting & API Usage

### Racing API Rate Limit

**All plan tiers:** 2 requests/second

### Backfill Rate Handling

**Automatic retry with exponential backoff:**
- Initial retry: 5 seconds wait
- Max retries: 5 attempts
- Rate limit detection: Automatic via HTTP 429 response

**Example from logs:**
```
2025-10-23 20:18:42 - events_fetcher - INFO - Fetching racecards for 2015-01-05
Rate limited, waiting 5s before retry
2025-10-23 20:18:47 - events_fetcher - INFO - Fetching racecards for 2015-01-06
```

### Enrichment Rate Limiting

When fetching complete horse data via `/v1/horses/{id}/pro`:
- Sleep 0.5 seconds between calls (2 req/sec)
- Only NEW horses enriched (not existing)
- Daily overhead: ~25 seconds for 50 new horses

### API Calls Per Backfill Chunk

**Per monthly chunk (30 days):**
- Racecards: 30 API calls (1 per day)
- Results: 1 API call (1 per month range)
- Horse enrichment: ~10-30 calls (new horses only)
- **Total:** ~40-60 API calls per chunk

**Full backfill (130 chunks):**
- **Total API calls:** ~6,000-8,000 calls
- **Time:** 5-6 hours (includes rate limit waits)

## 🎓 Key Technical Concepts

### 1. Hybrid Data Strategy

**Racecards (Pre-Race):**
- Fetched from `/v1/racecards/pro`
- Provides: Draw, weight, jockey/trainer/owner names
- Available: Before race starts

**Results (Post-Race):**
- Fetched from `/v1/results`
- Provides: Position, time, prize, starting price
- Available: After race completes

**Combined:** Both sources populate `ra_runners` with complete data

### 2. Entity Extraction

Automatically extracts and stores entities from runner data:
- Horses (with enrichment for NEW horses)
- Jockeys, trainers, owners
- Pedigree (sire, dam, damsire)

**No separate API calls needed** - entities extracted during race sync

### 3. Pro Enrichment

For NEW horses only:
- Fetches complete data from `/v1/horses/{id}/pro`
- Adds 9 additional fields: dob, sex_code, colour, region, etc.
- Captures complete pedigree with IDs
- Only ~50 horses/day need enrichment (others already in database)

### 4. Checkpoint/Resume

Backfill saves progress every chunk:
- Can interrupt and resume anytime
- Skips already-completed chunks
- Tracks position through 130 monthly chunks
- Use `--resume` flag to continue from checkpoint

### 5. UPSERT Operations

All database writes use UPSERT:
- Insert if new record
- Update if existing record (conflict on primary key)
- **Result:** No duplicates, always current data

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Don't Interrupt During Results Update

While the backfill can be interrupted safely, it's best to let each chunk complete:

```
✅ Safe to interrupt: During racecard fetching (can resume)
⚠️ Less ideal: During results update (chunk will restart)
```

Each chunk takes ~2-3 minutes, so just wait for:
```
Chunk X completed successfully
```

### 2. Historical Data Completeness

The Racing API Pro plan provides:
- ✅ Complete race results from 2015+
- ✅ Full runner details (positions, times, prizes)
- ✅ Complete entity data (horses, jockeys, trainers, owners)
- ✅ Pedigree information

**No data gaps** - full coverage for 10+ years

### 3. Regional Filtering

All data is filtered to **UK (GB) and Ireland (IRE) only**:
- Applied at API fetch level: `region_codes=['gb', 'ire']`
- Consistent across all fetchers
- No manual filtering needed

### 4. Statistics Require Source Data

The 4 statistics tables **MUST be calculated AFTER** backfill completes:
- They derive from `ra_race_results` table
- Cannot be calculated until historical data exists
- Run `populate_all_statistics.py` after backfill finishes

### 5. Resume Safety

If backfill is interrupted:

```bash
# Simply re-run with --resume flag
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 scripts/backfill/backfill_events.py \
  --start-date 2015-01-01 \
  --resume
```

**It will:**
- Read checkpoint file
- Skip completed chunks
- Continue from last position
- **Not create duplicates** (thanks to UPSERT)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Historical Data Requires Schema Flexibility

Pre-race fields (draw, weight, names) may be NULL in historical results:
- Make columns nullable when API data varies by context
- Use foreign keys for joins when names are NULL
- Document why NULLs are expected

### 2. Chunking Is Essential for Large Backfills

Processing 10+ years of data requires:
- Monthly chunks (manageable size)
- Checkpoint/resume capability
- Progress tracking
- Rate limit handling between chunks

### 3. UPSERT Enables Safe Re-runs

With UPSERT operations:
- Safe to re-run backfill anytime
- Refreshes data to latest state
- No duplicate handling needed
- Idempotent operations

### 4. Two-Phase Strategy Works Best

**Phase 1:** One-time large backfill
**Phase 2:** Ongoing incremental syncs

This separates concerns and allows different schedules for different data types.
